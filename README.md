# MESSAGING APP

## Introduction
A realtime messaging app where you can use your Google Account as an authentication method to log in and send messages with your friends. This web app is a good practice on how to use Firebase Realtime Database as well as how you can deploy your React Application to the server.

For the designing part of this application: The color of the application was mainly changed by ultilizing the OPACTITY of layers instead of using different color code. This design technique will be usefull for designing dark and light theme. In the other word, we only need to change the main background color and text color of application in order to change the whole app design color. 

The application was designed and programmed base on the WhatsApp application. It is best responsive on screen size: 1024 x 1366px (Ipad Pro screen size). It is not responsive for small screen mobile design.
